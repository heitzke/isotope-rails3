          Our process starts with Phase Zero, a session that involves a one to two day, face-to-face client meeting to review the precise features that the project will have at its completion.

          user stories
        %p
          At the same time, we generate mockups and user stories for each page in the application.  Doing this in-person with the client at the beginning of each project helps us guarantee that we have a firm, shared vision of the project to move forward.

        %h3 Implement
        %h4 minimum viable product
        %p
          From this initial vision, we build the simplest thing that will work, using test-driven development.  This allows us to put a working, albeit incomplete, product into the customer's hands in the earliest feasible timeline.

        %h3 Iterate
        %h4 hand-in-hand with customer
        %p
          At this point, we work alongside the customer to move the application from &ldquo;a thing that works&rdquo; to a product they love.  Getting this right requires a period of near-constant contact.

          %span.amp &amp;
          manage
        %p
          Now we get the current version of the product out the door and in the hands of the end-users.  As soon as users are involved, we can work with the client to not only build the product the client planned, but also the product and experience that their end-users desire.

          Web software is a living, breathing creature.  Metaphorically, of course.  You want to add and refine features to gain customers and keep them happy.  We aim to keep a tight feedback loop between shipping software and adding functionality.
