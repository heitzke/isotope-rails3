    %h3 We work with the community, locally and on the internet, to push the state of the art.

      We love open source, and we love to give back.

      When we're not constantly churning out work, we like to pick up and try out new development technologies, further hone our skills, and also give back to the great Ruby community by hosting monthly meetings (we have pizza too!). The meetings give many of us here a chance to further research interesting topics, as well as present to and discuss with other Ruby enthusiasts.
