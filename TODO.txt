- Backpage background needs some kind of subtle texture
- Backpage background also could use some interesting element...maybe a coffee
  stain.  Something to liven it up.  The rest of the site's interesting, don't
  want to bore people there.  Could be different element on different pages
  even.
- Blog button could use a 'shiny' look perhaps, the split button.  Is too plain
  currently.
- Tweak kerning on 'software development' header.  'A' is very separated from
  surrounding chars.
- line breaks in contact form
- Make map bubble in footer clickable
- Map controls showing up on iphone
- Contact form is awful
- 500 is broken
- 404 is broken
- add mobile examples
- review examples in general
- services subpages need navigation to see other services
- consider rewriting some content from POV of customer rather than dev.  Focus
  more on quality, delivery, track record than ruby, tech, niftiness
- blog needs more work
- add content re: experience with high availability, scalability
- get marketing guy to review content?
- Make homepage fast.  It's 1.5MB, geezus
- load footer map iframe via js after load, so orbit doesn't take forever to
  launch
- Don't just tell people what we do (software development) but how we'll solve
  their problems.  Worry-free software development?  Something.
- menu hover effects need to change, and any animations need to be fast.  200ms
  is the boundary at which point we're shitty
- Yet another person badmouthed our carousel.
- Transition to the 'how we do it' section too abrupt?  Desaturate a bit to
  reduce the contrast?
- 'How We Do It' section needs some context - explain to people what it is that
  we're listing.
- Map transition is again too over the top, and perhaps occludes the map a bit
  too much.
- Make sure header links are in the footer too.
- Can we re-use the divider bars elsewhere (that we use beside the headline)?
  We put a stake in the ground and then never re-use them.
