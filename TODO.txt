- Update 'years experience' in bios in db
- Backpage background needs some kind of subtle texture
- Backpage background also could use some interesting element...maybe a coffee
  stain.  Something to liven it up.  The rest of the site's interesting, don't
  want to bore people there.  Could be different element on different pages
  even.
- Blog button could use a 'shiny' look perhaps, the split button.  Is too plain
  currently.
- Tweak kerning on 'software development' header.  'A' is very separated from
  surrounding chars.
- Maybe tweak active/hover on menu?
- line breaks in contact form
- Make map bubble in footer clickable
- Map controls showing up on iphone
- Slider looks a little funky on the iphone
- Contact form is awful
