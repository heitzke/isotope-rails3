# Most Important or Low Hanging
- line breaks in contact form
- services subpages need navigation to see other services
- community subpages need navigation to see other siblings
- blog needs more work
- Make homepage fast.  It's 1.5MB, geezus
- load footer map iframe via js after load, so orbit doesn't take forever to
  launch
- Footer map looks wonky when blog button's missing now, my fault

# Bigger Design tweaks
- Backpage background also could use some interesting element...maybe a coffee
  stain.  Something to liven it up.  The rest of the site's interesting, don't
  want to bore people there.  Could be different element on different pages
  even.
- Transition to the 'how we do it' section too abrupt?  Desaturate a bit to
  reduce the contrast?
- 'How We Do It' section needs some context - explain to people what it is that
  we're listing.
- Map transition is again too over the top, and perhaps occludes the map a bit
  too much.
- Contact form is awful

# Content
- add mobile examples
- review examples in general
- add content re: experience with high availability, scalability
- get marketing guy to review content?
- Don't just tell people what we do (software development) but how we'll solve
  their problems.  Worry-free software development?  Something.
- consider rewriting some content from POV of customer rather than dev.  Focus
  more on quality, delivery, track record than ruby, tech, niftiness

# Later
- Map controls showing up on iphone
- 500 is broken
- 404 is broken
