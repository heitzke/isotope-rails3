- Backpage background needs some kind of subtle texture
- Backpage background also could use some interesting element...maybe a coffee
  stain.  Something to liven it up.  The rest of the site's interesting, don't
  want to bore people there.  Could be different element on different pages
  even.
- Blog button could use a 'shiny' look perhaps, the split button.  Is too plain
  currently.
- Tweak kerning on 'software development' header.  'A' is very separated from
  surrounding chars.
- Maybe tweak active/hover on menu?
- line breaks in contact form
- Make map bubble in footer clickable
- Map controls showing up on iphone
- Contact form is awful
- 500 is broken
- 404 is broken
- add mobile examples
- review examples in general
- services subpages need navigation to see other services
- need client resources link
- blog index needs to lose 'double blog header' and rss icon should go in blue
  header area
- consider rewriting some content from POV of customer rather than dev.  Focus
  more on quality, delivery, track record than ruby, tech, niftiness
- blog needs more work
- add content re: experience with high availability, scalability
- get marketing guy to review content?
- check out code styles on blog, are lame
- Make homepage fast.  It's 1.5MB, geezus
