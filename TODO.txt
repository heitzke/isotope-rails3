# Most Important or Low Hanging
- blog needs more work
- Make homepage fast.  It's 1.5MB, geezus
- Need a call to action in the 'how we do it' section on the homepage getting people to get in touch.
- Need 'thumbs' for each service that slide the slider on the homepage at 992px wide.
- add RSS auto discovery tag back to layout
- fix rel canonical links
- change 'how we do it' bg images to be actual bgs rather than img tags?  Fixes scrolling problem on iphone....
- 'calls to action' throughout the site.  Services pages and community pages should have them.  How we do it should figure out a way to work them in.  Perhaps one pre-footer on each page.  On a service show page, the only link in the top (and it's ugly) is 'back to services'.  Why would that be?  It should say 'Get in touch with us about your project!' or something and link to our contaact page WAY before it says back to services...

# Bigger Design tweaks
- Backpage background also could use some interesting element...maybe a coffee
  stain.  Something to liven it up.  The rest of the site's interesting, don't
  want to bore people there.  Could be different element on different pages
  even.
- Transition to the 'how we do it' section too abrupt?  Desaturate a bit to
  reduce the contrast?
- 'How We Do It' section needs some context - explain to people what it is that
  we're listing.

# Content
- review examples in general
- add content re: experience with high availability, scalability
- get marketing guy to review content?
- consider rewriting some content from POV of customer rather than dev.  Focus
  more on quality, delivery, track record than ruby, tech, niftiness
- Don't just tell people what we do (software development) but how we'll solve
  their problems.  Worry-free software development?  Something.
